# ClimbOn

Building a backyard climbing wall, and want to create a system for labeling routes electronically. Similar to the Moonboard, where you can select holds on the app and those holds will light up on the wall via LEDs.

Will interface via bluetooth to a microcontroller on my wall.

Am trying to make the software robust enough so that others can use it in the future too if they desire.

First time using android API, so probably tons of mis-usage.
